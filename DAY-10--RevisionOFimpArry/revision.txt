Going to revise first 6 questions of imp array question file, 
then after completing them thorughly I'll complete all the string questions(imp one) then I'll Start LinkedLists
LinkedLists is very imp from the pov of placements
after LinkedLists i dont think I have to put more efforts towards dsa for basics, as i've done all most imp questions, just need to revise all these questions, and start practicing on gfg and leetcode
