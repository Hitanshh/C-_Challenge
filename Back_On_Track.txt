after a long break due to final examination as well as I got an offer on-campus later on they removed my name from the list and didn't send me the LOI because of undigestable reason of MALPRACTICE, yeah they gave the reason as I did some malpractice which is impossible because of the following reasons;
1. the first_exam was conducted in college itself and there were 4 invegilators in the room as well as the exam was game based and english eassay writing in which all have different topics so how can I cheat.
2. the INTERVIEW, this was online from home, but the interviewer only took my INTRODUCTION and asked me a question about OOPs which was, what is encapsulation which I explained with examples as well(as this topic is the first that a person learns in coding and even a first year student can answer this question easily so why will I malpractice for this thing ), then he got happy and my interview ends here.

Now tell me where did I cheat? I guess they mistakenly did something, 

well.. I can't do anything now, so let's get back on track and start working on our skills again.
